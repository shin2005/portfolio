          My favorite subject is science. I like quantum mechanics, although
          it`s true that it`s very hard.Quantum mechanics is the field of
          science that tries to explain the behavior of particles on the
          sub-atomic level. Quantum mechanics began in the 20c, when Heisenberg,
          Schr√∂dinger, Plank, Einstein, and others, announced theories that
          would contribute to change modern physics forever. It led to the
          creation of the{" "}
