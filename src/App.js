        <p>
          I recently participated in a science contest. It was a writing contest
          about the use of{' '}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target="blank">
            big data
          </a>
          , and how it can be of use to humans.There are many uses of big data,
          because it utilizes massive amounts of information for various
          services. The data can act as statistics for developers to use.{' '}

          I recently became a class president in 2018. It was a close vote
          between 6 kids, but I won by just getting 17 people, just over half.{' '}

          , although it`s true that it`s very hard.Quantum mechanics is the
          field of science that tries to explain the behavior of particles on
          the sub-atomic level. Quantum mechanics began in the 20c, when
          Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Plank, Einstein, and others, announced
          theories that would contribute to change modern physics forever. It
          led to the creation of the{' '}

        <h2>What I want to do when I grow up</h2>
        <p>
          When I grow up I want to be a software developer. One project I
          thought of was making a website that would host games, but the games
          would be made by the users. The users could code the games to work on
          the website(with a little help from the company) and the profit could
          be shared with the company.{' '}
        </p>
        <h2>Side projects:</h2>
        <p>
          On Minecraft, I worked on a massive temple above the world. It was
          made out of every precious metal in the game, and you could make
          lighting strike at the temple. It could be seen from far away, and it
          was a great landmark.
        </p>
        <h2>Stuff that Interests Me</h2>
        <p>
          One of the things that I am most interested in is electronics. What
          interests me the most is news about Apple because it is my favorite
          comapany. But these days, I am getting more interested in the changes
          of the entire 4th Industrial Revolution, ranging from AI to
          self-driving cars to data privacy. I think that knowing the problems
          of the sudden changes of the 4th Industrial Revolution is as important
          as the changes because we will have to fix the changes someday, and
          its better to change them quickly. So I think that being aware is very
          important.
